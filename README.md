# TxAdmin Logging Script by Novek

This script allows you to monitor events from `txAdmin` and send important actions such as player warnings, bans, and whitelist requests to a Discord webhook. It provides an easy way to monitor activities on your server and receive real-time notifications.

## Features

- **Event Logging**: Sends logs of player warnings, bans, whitelist requests, and announcements to Discord.
- **Custom Webhook Integration**: You can specify a Discord webhook to receive notifications.
- **Multi-language Support**: Currently, the script supports English and German. More languages can be added easily.
- **Simple Configuration**: All settings, including the webhook and logo, can be easily customized.

## Installation

1. **Download the files**:
   Download the script and its files, and place them in the `resources/` folder of your server.

2. **Activate the resource**:
   Make sure to add the resource in your `server.cfg` with the following command:

   ```plaintext
   ensure txadmin logging
   ```

3. **Insert the Webhook URL**:  
   Open the file `resources/txadmin/shared/config.lua` and enter your Discord webhook URL:

   ```

4. **Customize the Logo URL**:  
   If you want to use a custom logo for the Discord messages, you can also edit the `Logo` URL in the config file:  
   ```lua
