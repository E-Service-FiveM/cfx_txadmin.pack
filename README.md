## üìÑ Overview

The **Noveks Admin Logs Script** allows server administrators to log all admin activities and events directly to a Discord channel. It helps to monitor server administration, quickly identify issues, and maintain control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Download the script** and place it in the **`resources`** folder of your server.
2. **Add the script to `server.cfg`**:
    ```lua
    ensure Noveks_AdminLogs
    ```
3. **Insert Webhook URL**:
   - Go to your Discord server and create a webhook in a desired channel.
   - Copy the webhook URL and paste it into the **`Noveks_CFG.txAdminWebhook`** setting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Configuration is done via the **`Noveks_CFG`** table in the script. You can adjust the following settings:

- **Webhook URL**: The Discord webhook URL for the log channel.
- **Bot Name**: The name of the bot that sends the logs.
- **Bot Logo**: The logo that appears when the bot sends logs.
- **Filter Announcements**: Enable or disable the display of admin announcements.
- **Language (locale)**: Set the script language to English (en) or German (de).

### Example Configuration:

```lua
Noveks_CFG = {}

-- ================================================ =========================
-- Webhook URL (Discord)
Noveks_CFG.txAdminWebhook = 'YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL' -- <-- Insert webhook here

-- ================================================ =========================
-- Bot settings
Noveks_CFG.Username = 'TxAdminLogs' -- Name of the Bot on your Discord Server
Noveks_CFG.Logo = 'https://your-bot-logo-link.png' -- <-- URL for the server logo

-- ================================================ =========================
-- Filter Announcements: true = show only admin announcements
Noveks_CFG.FilterAnnouncements = true -- true/false to filter announcements
-- ================================================ =========================
-- Language settings
Noveks_CFG.locale = 'en' -- [en]for English -/- [de] for German
```

## üåç Languages

Currently, the script supports the following languages:
- English (`en`)
- German (`de`)

## üì¢ Additional Features

- **Real-time Logs**: All admin actions are sent directly to the Discord channel.
- **Customizable Settings**: Set the bot's name and logo to match your server's style.
- **Admin Filter**: Filter which admin activities and announcements are displayed.

## üöÄ How it Works

1. The script monitors all admin actions on your server.
2. When an admin action occurs, a message with the action details is sent to the Discord webhook.
3. You can customize the type of information and the bot sending the messages according to your preferences.
